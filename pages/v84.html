Coq 8.4 is available in <a href="/distrib/V8.4beta">beta</a> testing. It features:

<ul>
<li> a new modular and uniform extension of the arithmetical libraries by
  P. Letouzey which systematically provides power, gcd/lcm, square
  root, base 2 logarithm, division, modulo, bitwise operators, logical
  shift, comparisons, iterators on top of a uniform naming layer
  (e.g. plus and mult are now consistently named add and mul while
  still remaining mostly compatible with 8.3);</li>
<li> a new proof engine by A. Spiwack whose most salient feature is the
  introduction of bullets (+, -, *) and structured scripts ({ ... }).</li>
</ul>

The main other changes are:

<ul>
<li> addition of eta-conversion to the logic;</li>
<li> a slightly more flexible guard condition for fixpoints;</li>
<li> a more systematic support for pattern-matching on dependent types;</li>
<li> more robust CoqIDE (including a new communication protocol by V. Gross);</li>
<li> a new library of "vectors" (lists of a given length);</li>
<li> support for referring to expressions of the goal using pattern in tactics;</li>
<li> automatic computation of occurrences to abstract over in destruct/induction;</li>
<li> various improvements to Ltac (timeout, eq_constr, is_evar, has_evar,
  timeout, generic "match _ with _ => _ end" pattern);</li>
<li> implicit arguments in anonymous functions;</li>
<li> notations with binders (e.g. "exists x y z, P");</li>
<li> many bug fixes and improvements of existing features (type classes,
  setoid rewriting, nsatz, micromega, extraction, Function, module
  system, coq_makefile, ...);</li>
</ul>
